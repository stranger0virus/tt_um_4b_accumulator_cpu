  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "A minimal 4-bit accumulator-driven CPU where each instruction from ROM operates on the accumulator via an ALU (ADD, SUB, AND, OR), with the accumulator storing the result of each operation for the next cycle."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     100000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_4b_tiny_cpu"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
  source_files:
    - "alu.v"
    - "rom.v"
